# Lectio Signum

Lectio Signum, which includes both hardware and software components, aims to provide fast, reliable translation of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into English performed by any user who makes use of the sign language. This is accomplished by measuring, processing, and classifying biological signals including electromyograph (EMG) and motion data from an inertail measurement unit (IMU) that are retrieved from the dominant hand/arm of the user. By doing so, we aim to expand the boundaries that are unfortunately experienced by the deaf community and hope to promote empowerment and inclusion by allowing them to have more effective communication with the hearing population.
